first home work assignment by Steven Scott
This is the Landing page website of a company called Horiseon. 
This page has three links in the Header element area. They redirect the user to the relevant area of the website.
It has three different aricles or sections to describe what the company offers. 
Adding to this is the aside bar to the right hand side of the screen with additional information of the services given by Horiseon. 
This is the first homework assignment for the Monash Coding Bootcamp.
Below is a screen shot of the website.
